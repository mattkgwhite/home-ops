## Setup

### Prerequisites for Cluster:
 
**CSI Driver** - Access to remote storage via a CIFs Share. To install use one of the following depending on Host Node OS:

    ```
    Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install -y cifs-utils`
    CentOS: `yum -y install cifs-utils`
    ```

### ðŸ’¾ Storage

Remote Storage: 
This functionality requires the CSI-Driver to be install from the `Prerequisites for Cluster:` section. Once install will provide the ability of the cluster to reference remote storage options such as [Hetzner's Storage Boxes](https://www.hetzner.com/storage/storage-box), which are scaleable options for remote storage.
