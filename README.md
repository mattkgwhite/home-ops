## Core Components

## Ansible

## Kubernetes

These are the configurations for kuberentes specifically for GitOps applications [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/) and [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/). *These configurations are a work in progress and are subject to change.*

The configurations contain basic functionality of kubernetes that are specific to both ArgoCD and FluxCD, to test applications or for permanent configuration and deployment.

Basic functionality, includes SSL (Cert-Manager), DNS (External DNS), Ingress (Gateway / Ingress-Nginx / Kong), Monitoring (Kube-Prometheus-Stack - Grafana, Loki, PrometheusDB), Secret Management (External Secrets & 1Password)
